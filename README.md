# latest-pytorch-rocm
Newer* Gentoo ROCM

This is with PyTorch in mind, so the list of packages is taken from that dependency graph and only the ROCM packages are getting worked on

This project only aims to create a working build of PyTorch with a newer ROCM, and its not even trying to give it thorough testing.

Currently working on version 6.2.4.
Some new packages are needed...
A lot of changes in current patches.
Some new patches.
!FUN!
